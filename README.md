## Installation

To use the examples and utilities in this repository, you need to have Python and PostgreSQL installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install psycopg2-binary
```

Alternatively, you can install the dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

This repository contains various examples of how to use `psycopg` to interact with a PostgreSQL database. Each example is contained in its own Python script and is documented to help you understand the operations being performed.

To run an example, simply execute the corresponding Python script:

```bash
python example_script.py
```

Make sure to update the database connection parameters (such as `host`, `database`, `user`, and `password`) in the scripts to match your PostgreSQL setup.
